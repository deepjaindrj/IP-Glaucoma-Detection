# GlaucoCare - Glaucoma Analysis Tool

-GlaucoCare, a web application developed in support of computer-aided glaucoma diagnosis. 

-Once a user has uploaded a fundus image, Glaucocare will automatically screen the fundus image for the presence of glaucoma using a back-end engine that has been built on top of our most effective predictive model. 

-If the image is diagnosed to be glaucomatous, then Glaucocare will generate the prediction probability, visualize the heatmap and highlights glaucomatous area using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Grad-CAM).

- Glaucocare takes as input a fundus image (JPG, PNG, or BMP), showing the diagnosis outcome to the user as soon as the given fundus image has been analyzed by the model in the back-end.
